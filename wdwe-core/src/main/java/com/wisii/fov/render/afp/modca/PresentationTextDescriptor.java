/**
 * The Presentation Text Descriptor specifies the units of measure for the
 * Presentation Text object space, the size of the Presentation Text object
 * space, and the initial values for modal parameters, called initial text
 * conditions. Initial values not provided are defaulted by the controlling
 * environment or the receiving device.
 *
 * The Presentation Text Descriptor provides the following initial values:
 * - Unit base
 * - Xp-units per unit base
 * - Yp-units per unit base
 * - Xp-extent of the presentation space
 * - Yp-extent of the presentation space
 * - Initial text conditions.
 *
 * The initial text conditions are values provided by the Presentation Text
 * Descriptor to initialize the modal parameters of the control sequences.
 * Modal control sequences typically are characterized by the word set in
 * the name of the control sequence. Modal parameters are identified as such
 * in their semantic descriptions.
