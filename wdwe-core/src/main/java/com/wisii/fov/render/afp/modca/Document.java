/**
 * The document is the highest level of the MO:DCA data-stream document
 * component hierarchy. Documents can be made up of pages, and the pages,
 * which are at the intermediate level, can be made up of objects. Objects
 * are at the lowest level, and can be bar codes, graphics, images, and
 * presentation text.
 *
 * At each level of the hierarchy certain sets of MO:DCA data structures,
 * called structured fields, are permissible. The document, pages and objects
 * are bounded by structured fields that define their beginnings and their ends.
 * These structured fields, called begin-end pairs, provide an envelope for the
 * data-stream components. This feature enables a processor of the data stream
 * that is not fully compliant with the architecture to bypass those objects
 * that are beyond its scope, and to process the data stream to the best of its
 * abilities.
 *
 * A presentation document is one that has been formatted and is intended for
 * presentation, usually on a printer or display device. A data stream containing
 * a presentation document should produce the same document content in the
 * same format on different printers or display devices dependent, however,
 * on the capabilities of each of the printers or display devices. A presentation
 * document can reference resources that are to be included as part of the
 * document to be presented.
